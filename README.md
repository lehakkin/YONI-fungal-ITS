# YONI-fungal-ITS
RStudio anlaysis of fungal ITS2 MiSeq sequences from four differently managed soils, forest, meadow, organic cropping system and conventional cropping system, and five soil layers, 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, 30-40 cm, and 40-80 cm. Analysis include alpha and beta diversity, Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) , PERMANOVA, composition barplots etc.

In the project, I compare the effects of the four different soil management types and the five different soil layers on the soil fungal communities. The results help understanding how and how deep soil management influence soil fungi. Multiple soil properties including root biomass, pH, carbon (C), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P-tot), water-extractable P (P-H2O), organic P (P-org), inorganic P (P-inorg), aluminum oxide, and iron oxide concentrations are tested for their ability explain variations in fungal community differences, richness and relative abundance. Code aim to provide processing  steps for reproducible data analysis. Results will be published later as a research article (wait for update). The project is maintained by the lehakkin.
